#	Title:		Assignment 2																																																					
#	Introduction:																																																								
#	This is a program that cleans up a clip from an old black-and-white movie.																																								
#
#	This program functions with the following steps:																																																	
#	1. It prompts the user to select their desired video file.
#	2. It reads 5 frames from the video into an array. These frames will be used for denoising. If no frames are captured, the loop will be broken.
#	3. Convert all of the images to grayscale, then to float64. This is used to add noise in the next step.
#	4. A noise of variance 25 is then created and added to the captured frames. 
#	5. The noisy images are converted back to uint8 for processing.
#	6. A white image is created based on the size of one of the frames. This image will be used to create a mask in a later step.
#	7. The program will increment a count value for each frame that is processed. If the value is within the defined range of frames required, it will
#		perform processing on the frame. If not, the count will be incremented and the frame position will be moved back 4 places. Moving the position 
#		back 4 places enables a previously read frame to be read again. This is because once the video reader reads a frame, it will move on to the 
#		next frame and ignore the previous unprocessed frames. 
#	8. The fastNlMeansDenoisingMulti() function is used to denoise the frames. It uses 5 frames to denoise the third frame (output).
#	9. The pixels are averaged to reduce the remaining small-grain noise.
#	10. If there is no previous frame, set it to the averaged frame. The previous image is used to perform a delta with the current image in the next step. 
#	11. Once the difference is found, it is thresholded to create a binary image. This binary image is used to find contours. Contours that are too small
#		or large are ignored, and the remaining contours are drawn onto the white image and the original image.
#	12. The white image is used to create a binary mask, which is inverted to be able to use in the inpaint() function.
#	13. Inpaint() function is used to remove the detected changes by painting over it to match the neighborhood pixels.
#	14. The processed frame is written to the same directory as the selected video file.

#
#	Performance:																																																								
#	1. The denoising function performs very slowly, which is why the output is 10 defined frames instead of a video file.
#	2. The program will only run as long as it has not reached the defined end frame.	
#	3. Noise is added because the denoising function will work better if there is a known noise. Please see Reference #9.														
#
#	Experiments:																							
#	1. To include links in this file, the first line had to be implemented. This solution was found online. Please see Reference #1.
#	2. The input file type was used as the output file type, but it could not find the library (for mp4 in the case of Zorro). This functionality was 
#		scrapped to prevent	compatibility issues.
#	3. Images without added noise was used, but found that the quality is worse. Noise is added to the image before processing.
#	4. The output looks better when the contours are drawn onto both the white image and the frame.
